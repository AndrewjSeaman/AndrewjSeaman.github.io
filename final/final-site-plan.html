        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This website will serve as an online point of contact between my customers and I. It will allow me to direct
            potential customers here by posting a link on the paper flyers I distribute. Also, when I begin advertising
            in locations like Facebook I will be able to have a place for interested customers to go and get the
            information they need to hire me. The site will have a form so they can send me their information as well as
            information about me and my brother (who own the company). It will also have customer reviews alongside
            before and after photos. </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Eventhough to date my brother and I have distributed about 1000 flyers it's back breaking work. It would be
            much easier for people to be able to see our information in passing, become interested, travel to our site,
            fill out the form, receive a follow up text or call from me, and then have us perform our service for them.
            My audience is anyone with a trash can who needs it cleaned. That's adults, not children or teens, and it's
            any age of adult. Wealthier individuals seem to expect this type of service whereas middle class individuals
            and lower do not. However, whoever is interested and can pay is who I'm looking for.</p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: "Crimson Pro"</h4>
        <p>In the logo I used a font called "Hoefler Text" but that font is unavailable as either a default font or a
            google font. However, "Crimson Pro" is a very close second as it is designed after "Hoefler Text".</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: "Crimson Pro (Italic)"</h4>
        <p>I really like this font. But, the reason I don't want to use several fonts is because it keeps the focus on
            the fonts low profile. It looks good and people need to be focusing on the service, what they want, and so
            the more consistency I can give them the better. I can manage sizing later using css.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eveniet, omnis voluptas consequuntur voluptatibus
            tempore deleniti! Tempore ipsum magnam et fugit labore libero dolorum repellat harum!.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
