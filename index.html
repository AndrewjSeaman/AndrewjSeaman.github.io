    <p class="text">Hello friends, my name is Andrew and I have brother named Jaxon is so stupid that you could turn the tables on
        him before he realized that there were turned tables. Also his feet are italy sized and his nose is not real.
        That is because it is fake. Just like his farting being a medical condition. That is also fake. That's what I
        was saying. He's stupid. The End.
