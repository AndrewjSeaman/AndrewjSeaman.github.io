        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain which constructs hotels within close proximity of Latter-day Saint
            temples across the world. These hotels are specially located to accomodate patrons of those temples,
            including workers, and their families while they stay in the area with the intent to worship. Many travel
            far for this sacred opportunity and so reasonable accomodations are made for them to rest in a wholesome
            place of peace and comfort that is conducive to the spirit of their worship. All are welcome, however, and
            are invited to embrace the proper decorum as layed out by the hotel during their stay.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>We are here to serve people all who would stay in the safe, comfortable environment of our hotels. We
            regularly cater to groups both large and small of all ages. Many who stay with us are patrons to the
            latter-day saint temples around which we construct our hotels. Indeed, we often house temple workers and
            their families as many travel great distances to serve in what they deem "the Lord's house." In keeping with
            the sacred spirit with which these individuals go about their worship we that all our guests to adopt,
            during their stay, the official Temple Inn & Suites decorum. Come one, come all to your home beyond home.
